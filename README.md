# Pneumonia-detection
This project shows the difference between deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks in image classification task and data preparation steps. The project presents classifications of X-ray images of the lungs. The dataset includes lung pneumonia and healthy ones. Steps such as dataset creation, data regularization are included. The project has two models, a baseline model which has a simple network architecture consisting of deep layers, and a second target model containing more layers, including convolutional layers. To see the difference between the two models better, I made a visualization of training process.  I used Tensorflow to build the networks.
